First time writing a README, I'm sorry in advance

This project is just a small P5.JS project that connects to your Twitch Channel and displays the messages sent there in a moving and nice way.

It is still a WIP and needs to be improved to look better : 

- Handle when many messages are sent at once
- Handle big messages
- Make a way to control how it looks
- Handle timing
- Make a better README
